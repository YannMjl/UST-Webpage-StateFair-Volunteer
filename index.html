                        </p>
                            
                            <li>A 30-minute admissions presentation</li>

                                        <b>  The University of St. Thomas does not pay for group transportation or meals.</b>
                                                                For those groups willing to pay for their own meals while on campus, the Office of Admissions can assist the group with on-campus meal arrangements.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                                  Please bring one adult chaperone for every 10 students. It is the responsibility of each chaperone to monitor the behavior of their students. Inadequate student conduct or adult supervision, can result in a group losing future visit privileges. 
                                     </p>
